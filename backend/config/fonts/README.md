# Custom Fonts

This folder is for custom font files that can be used in the text overlay feature.

## How to Add Custom Fonts

1. Place your font files (`.ttf` or `.otf`) in this directory
2. Name the file exactly as you want it to appear in the font selector
3. The font will automatically be available in the Custom Text Overlay panel

## Supported Formats

- TrueType Fonts (`.ttf`)
- OpenType Fonts (`.otf`)

## Example

If you have a font file named `Montserrat.ttf`, place it in this folder and it will appear as "Montserrat" in the font family selector.

## System Fonts

The following system fonts are available by default:
- Arial
- Helvetica
- Times New Roman
- Georgia
- Verdana
- Courier New
- Impact

## Notes

- Font file names are case-sensitive
- If a custom font has the same name as a system font, the custom font will be used
- Font files should be properly licensed for your use case
